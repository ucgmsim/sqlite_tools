    "## 2. Understanding SQLite Query Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to communicate with databases. SQLite uses a dialect of SQL. Here are some common clauses:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name`**: This is the most fundamental clause. It retrieves specified columns from a table.\n",
    "    *   `SELECT * FROM table_name` selects all columns.\n",
    "*   **`WHERE condition`**: Filters records based on a specific condition. \n",
    "    *   Example: `WHERE age > 30` or `WHERE name = 'Alice'`.\n",
    "*   **`JOIN another_table ON table_name.column_name = another_table.column_name`**: Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.\n",
    "    *   Common types: `INNER JOIN` (default), `LEFT JOIN`.\n",
    "*   **`ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC]`**: Sorts the result set by one or more columns, either in ascending (`ASC`, default) or descending (`DESC`) order.\n",
    "*   **`LIMIT number`**: Restricts the number of rows returned by the query.\n",
    "*   **`GROUP BY column_name`**: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. Often used with aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of a more complex query structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    t1.columnA, \n",
